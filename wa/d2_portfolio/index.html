        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Wiley Yankopoulos</b> is a Unit Stills Photographer based in Boulder, CO. 
            His work primarily focuses on people, captured through unit stills and lifestyle photography.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a unit photographer, my job is to create strong, sharp stills that highlight the lead actors 
            and tell just enough of the story to spark curiosity. I anticipate what the marketing team will 
            need for promotion, always supporting that with behind-the-scenes coverage that illustrates 
            the filmmaking process.

        <h2>Testimonial</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            “Wiley was an excellent Unit Stills photographer to have while on set. He kept out of the way while 
            still capturing fantastic moments of the cast and crew. On top of having a great eye, he was careful 
            and considerate when it came to posting or sharing sensitive content that could spoil the film. 
            I would strongly recommend Wiley to anyone seeking a top-tier Unit Photographer.”

        <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
        <p>
            Content inventory: What information will you include in each section?
            <br>&emsp;I am taking heavy inspiration from my actual portfolio website (copying my copy)
                <br>
            Audience consideration: Who might visit your site and why?
            <br>&emsp; People who will hire me
                <br>
            Structure planning: How will you organize your content using semantic HTML?
            <br>&emsp;I will use HTML and put each categories in h2 headers with the rest in p tags
                <br>
            Examples analysis: Notes on 2-3 personal websites you found inspiring
                <br>&emsp;https://www.franckgerard.eu/ and https://jaymaidment.com/ and https://www.aimeespinks.com/
                <br>
            Reflection: "What aspects of your identity do you want to represent online? What concerns do you have?
            <br>&emsp;it needs to represent my desire to be a paid unit photographer -> which means only having photos that push that front forward
